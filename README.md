## Analyses and Tinkerings

I keep my code here, mostly scRNA-seq analysis R code, but anything else I try out (some *secret* stuff too!).

- I'm currently working on analysing different kinds of data to find biomarkers of resistance to VEN-DEC combination therapy in AML patients.
- I'm learning more about Linux and the command line interface.
- I'm also trying to learn C++!
- I like to think I speak a few (human) languages.
- My interest in programming and languages led me to develop an interest in software documentation too, so I'm reading on that.
